## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.
Stack is a ist of elements that is that's accessible only from one end of the list , which is called the top
One real example is trays in citchen, trays are removed from the top, and when trays are put back on the stack after being watched
they are placed at the top of the stack, last in first out is data structure.
The nature of the stack data structure suggest that any element that is below of the top could'nt be acceesed, to get
that element you should remove all ones that is above it


Queue: the data are inserted at the end and are removed from the front, queues are stored data in the order in which they occured.
common example is the line of persons in bank to get such service

Stack and queue are more efficient that arrays, use stack when you want to get data at the same order, while it is reverse when you use stack>
